              Many lifters wonder: what is the best workout split? A good workout split can make or break your training progress. The best workout split helps you build muscle, recover well, and stay consistent over time. But the perfect split depends on your experience, goals, and lifestyle.

              What Makes a Good Workout Split?
            </h2>
            <p>
              A good workout split should train each muscle group often enough to stimulate growth but allow enough rest for recovery. It should match your weekly availability and keep you motivated. The best workout split also fits your training level and adapts as you get stronger.

              Popular Workout Splits
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                <strong>Full-Body Split:</strong> Great for busy people or beginners. Hit all major muscle groups 2-3 times per week. Many beginners love full-body training because it teaches good form and builds a strong base. It's also forgiving if you miss a workout — you won't skip an entire muscle group.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Upper/Lower Split:</strong> Train upper body and lower body on separate days. Good balance of frequency and recovery, 3-4 days per week.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Push/Pull/Legs (PPL):</strong> Train push muscles, pull muscles, and legs on different days. Common for intermediate lifters training 4-6 days weekly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bro Split:</strong> One muscle group per day (e.g., chest day, back day). Not ideal for beginners, but can work for advanced lifters focused on volume.
              </li>

              How to Pick the Best Workout Split for You
            </h2>
            <p>
              The best workout split is the one you can stick to. If you can only train three times a week, a full-body or upper/lower split is often better than trying to squeeze in a six-day PPL. <Link to="/tips/train-muscle-twice-a-week" className="font-bold text-teal-800 hover:underline">More frequency</Link> usually means more progress, but only if you recover properly.
              If you feel tired or stuck, try lowering your volume or switching to a simpler split for a few weeks. Sometimes, less is more.
