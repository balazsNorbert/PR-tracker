            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">Do You Remember Your Last Workout?</h2>
            <p>
              If you're training regularly but not tracking your sessions, you're missing out on a powerful tool for progress. Workout tracking helps you stay focused, measure results, and make smarter decisions in the gym.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">What Does Tracking Mean?</h2>
            <p>
              Tracking workouts simply means writing down what you do: the exercises, sets, reps, weights, rest times, and even how you felt. Whether on paper or in an app, it's about creating a record you can learn from.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">1. See Your Progress Over Time</h3>
            <p>
              It's hard to appreciate how far you've come without looking back. Tracking shows the growth: lifting heavier, running faster, or improving endurance.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">2. Stay Accountable</h3>
            <p>
              A log keeps you honest. It motivates you to show up and push through, especially on days you're tempted to slack off.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">3. Identify Patterns and Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
              By reviewing your logs, you might notice consistent struggles with certain lifts or fatigue after specific sessions. This info helps you adapt your plan.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">4. Make Your Training Smarter</h3>
            <p>
              Without tracking, it's easy to repeat the same workout over and over. With data, you can progressively overload or adjust volume and intensity for optimal growth.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">5. Boost Motivation</h3>
            <p>
              Nothing is more motivating than seeing how far you've come. Looking back at your progress can keep you going when motivation dips.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Tracking your workouts turns your training into a strategy. It helps you stay organized, driven, and informed. If you want to train with purpose, start tracking today—you'll be surprised how much it accelerates your results.
