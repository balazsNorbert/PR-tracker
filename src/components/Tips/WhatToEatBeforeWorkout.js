              Why Pre-Workout Nutrition Matters
            </h2>
            <p>
              Knowing what to eat before a workout is key to providing your body with the fuel it needs to perform at its best. Proper pre-workout nutrition not only boosts your energy but also helps delay fatigue, enhances endurance, and improves strength and focus during exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, what you consume can affect your recovery and how well your muscles respond to training, making it a crucial part of your overall fitness plan.

              What to Eat Before Your Workout
            </h2>
            <p>
              For optimal performance, prioritize carbohydrates as your primary fuel source. Carbs are quickly converted to glucose, your body's preferred energy during exercise. Include moderate amounts of protein to aid muscle support, but limit fats and fiber as they digest slower and can cause discomfort.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Fresh fruits like bananas, apples, or berries — packed with quick energy and antioxidants</li>
              <li>Whole-grain options like oats or whole-wheat toast with a light spread of peanut or almond butter</li>
              <li>Greek yogurt combined with a drizzle of honey for protein and natural sugars</li>
              <li>Rice cakes topped with almond butter for a light but energizing snack</li>
              <li>Specialized energy bars designed to fuel workouts</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Timing Your Pre-Workout Meal
            </h2>
            <p>
              Timing is just as important as what you eat. Aim to have a well-balanced meal containing carbs, protein, and a small amount of fat 1-2 hours before exercising. This allows your body to digest and convert nutrients into usable energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your schedule doesn't allow for a meal, opt for a small snack 30-60 minutes before your workout. Keep it light and easy to digest to avoid stomach discomfort.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Hydration is Key
            </h2>
            <p>
              Staying hydrated amplifies the benefits of your pre-workout meal. Drink water consistently throughout the day. About 30 minutes before training, consume 250-500 ml of water to ensure optimal hydration without feeling bloated.
            </p>

              Sample Pre-Workout Snack Ideas
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>A banana with a tablespoon of natural peanut butter for carbs and healthy fats</li>
              <li>Greek yogurt topped with a handful of fresh berries for protein and antioxidants</li>
              <li>A small bowl of oatmeal mixed with sliced almonds and honey for sustained energy</li>
              <li>A fruit smoothie with protein powder, spinach, and a bit of almond milk for balanced nutrients</li>
              <li>Whole-grain toast topped with mashed avocado and a sprinkle of sea salt for healthy fats and carbs</li>
            </ul>

              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
