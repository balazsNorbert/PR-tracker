              Walk into any gym and you'll see shelves full of powders and pills promising muscle gains. But do you really need supplements to build muscle? Let's break down what actually helps, what's optional, and what's just marketing hype.

              What Really Builds Muscle?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Supplements can help fill gaps, but they're not magic. The real drivers of muscle growth are <Link to="/tips/what-is-progressive-overload" className="font-bold text-teal-800 hover:underline">progressive overload</Link>, proper <Link to="/tips/why-track-your-nutrition" className="font-bold text-teal-800 hover:underline">nutrition</Link>, <Link to="/tips/how-much-protein-you-need" className="font-bold text-teal-800 hover:underline">enough protein</Link>, sleep, and <Link to="/tips/how-to-stay-consistent-working-out" className="font-bold text-teal-800 hover:underline">consistency</Link>. If those basics aren't in place, no supplement will make up for it.

              Which Supplements Actually Work?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Not all supplements are useless. A few have strong evidence behind them:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                <strong>Whey Protein:</strong> Helps you reach your daily protein goals conveniently, especially if you struggle to get enough from food.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Creatine Monohydrate:</strong> One of the most studied supplements — boosts strength and muscle size over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Vitamin D & Omega-3:</strong> Useful if you're deficient, supporting overall health and recovery.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Which Supplements Can You Skip?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Many trendy products promise big gains but do very little:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                <strong>BCAAs:</strong> If you're already eating enough protein, BCAAs are usually unnecessary.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fat Burners:</strong> Often filled with caffeine and fillers — focus on diet and training instead.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Testosterone Boosters:</strong> Most “test boosters” have little to no proven effect for healthy people.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Can You Build Muscle Without Supplements?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Absolutely! Many people get great results just by eating a balanced diet rich in protein (like chicken, eggs, fish) and training consistently. Supplements are just convenient — they're not essential.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              Supplements can be helpful, but they're not required for muscle growth. Focus on training hard, eating enough quality food, getting plenty of sleep, and staying consistent. If you do add supplements, choose ones backed by science and use them to support — not replace — the basics.
