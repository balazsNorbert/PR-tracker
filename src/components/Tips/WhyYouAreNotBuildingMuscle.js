              Struggling to Build Muscle Despite Regular Training?
            </h2>
            <p>
              If you're consistently hitting the gym but not seeing results, you're not alone. Many people train hard but fail to make real progress because of key mistakes in their routine, nutrition, or recovery. Understanding why you are not building muscle is the first step toward real growth.

            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              1. You're Not Eating Enough
            </h2>
            <p>
              Building muscle requires a calorie surplus. If you're not consuming enough food—especially protein and carbs—your body won't have the fuel it needs to grow. Track your intake and make sure you're eating more than you burn.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              2. Poor Training Intensity or Volume
            </h2>
            <p>
              Simply showing up at the gym isn't enough. You need to challenge your muscles with proper intensity, progressive overload, and enough sets and reps. Make sure your training is structured and goal-focused.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              3. Not Getting Enough Sleep or Recovery
            </h2>
            <p>
              Muscle growth happens outside the gym—while you rest. Without adequate sleep (7-9 hours) and recovery time between workouts, your body can't rebuild stronger muscles. Overtraining can actually halt progress.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              4. You're Inconsistent
            </h2>
            <p>
              Consistency beats intensity over time. Sporadic workouts or constantly changing programs prevent your body from adapting. Stick to a structured plan and give it time to work.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              5. You're Not Tracking Progress
            </h2>
            <p>
              Without tracking your workouts, weight, or nutrition, you're guessing. Keep a log to monitor improvements and make adjustments when necessary. Small tweaks over time make a big difference.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              If you're not building muscle, don't get discouraged. Most problems come down to a few fixable habits. Focus on eating enough, training smart, recovering well, and staying consistent—and you'll start seeing real gains.
