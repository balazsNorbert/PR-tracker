              Why Workout Duration Matters
            </h2>
            <p>
              How long your workouts should be depends on several factors: your training goals, your fitness level, and how much time you realistically have. Finding the right balance helps you stay consistent, avoid burnout, and make meaningful progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Short, effective workouts are often more beneficial than long, unfocused sessions — especially for people with busy schedules. It's about working smarter, not just longer.

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li><strong>General health & fitness:</strong> 30-45 minutes, 3-5x per week</li>

              <li><strong>Fat loss (HIIT/circuit training):</strong> 20-40 minutes, 3-5x per week</li>
              <li><strong>Strength & power:</strong> 60-90 minutes, depending on rest periods</li>
              <li><strong>Endurance training:</strong> 60-120 minutes, especially for long-distance goals</li>

              How to Structure an Efficient Workout
            </h2>
            <p>
              An effective session usually includes a short warm-up (5-10 minutes), focused training (20-60 minutes), and a cool-down (5-10 minutes). Whether you're lifting weights, running, or doing bodyweight circuits, keeping your rest times under control and avoiding distractions can make a huge difference.

              Signs You Might Be Training Too Long
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>You feel excessively fatigued after every session</li>
              <li>You notice declining performance or motivation</li>
              <li>Your workouts regularly exceed 90-120 minutes without clear purpose</li>
              <li>You're skipping recovery or neglecting other responsibilities</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Consistency Beats Duration
            </h2>
            <p>
              Training consistently for shorter periods is more effective than sporadic long sessions. A focused 30-minute workout 5 times a week often beats 2-hour gym marathons once or twice. Recovery, sleep, and smart programming matter more than duration alone.
            </p>

              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              There's no universal "perfect" workout length. Aim for sessions that are long enough to be effective but short enough to maintain quality and consistency. Focus on intensity, rest when needed, and adjust over time based on your progress and schedule.
