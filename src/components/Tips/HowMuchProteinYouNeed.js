            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">Why Protein Matters ?</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing how much protein you need each day is essential for building muscle, supporting recovery, and maintaining a healthy body. Whether you're training to gain mass, lose fat, or just stay in shape, getting enough protein daily is key to success.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also plays a critical role in hormone production, immune function, and maintaining skin, hair, and nails. Unlike carbs and fat, your body doesn't store protein in the same way — so daily intake matters more than you think.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">General Protein Guidelines</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Sedentary adults: ~0.8g per kg of body weight</li>
              <li>Active individuals: 1.2-2.0g/kg depending on intensity</li>
              <li>Muscle building: 1.6-2.2g/kg (or ~0.7-1g/lb)</li>
              <li>Fat loss (with training): ~2.0-2.4g/kg to preserve muscle</li>
              <li>Athletes and bodybuilders: Often closer to 2.0-2.5g/kg</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These are general recommendations. For personalized advice, especially if you have medical conditions, consult a dietitian or health professional.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">Example Calculation</h3>
            <p>
              If you weigh 70kg (154 lbs) and want to build muscle, aim for:
              <br />
              <span className="font-semibold">70kg x 2g = 140g protein per day</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Spread that across 4 meals a day, and that's about 35g of protein per meal — completely doable with a balanced diet.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">Best Protein Sources</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Lean meats (chicken, turkey, beef)</li>
              <li>Fish (salmon, tuna, cod)</li>
              <li>Eggs and dairy (Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, milk)</li>
              <li>Protein powders (whey, casein, pea, rice, soy)</li>
              <li>Plant-based: lentils, tofu, tempeh, chickpeas, edamame, quinoa</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you're vegan or vegetarian, it's important to combine different plant sources to get all essential amino acids — like rice and beans or lentils and quinoa.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">How to Distribute Protein</h2>
            <p>
              For optimal muscle protein synthesis (MPS), aim to include at least 20-40g of protein every 3-5 hours throughout the day. Skipping long gaps between meals helps avoid muscle breakdown.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider pairing protein with fiber or healthy fats (like olive oil or avocado) to stay full longer and support overall nutrition.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">Common Myths About Protein</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li><span className="font-semibold">"Too much protein harms your kidneys"</span> — In healthy individuals, there is no strong evidence supporting this.</li>
              <li><span className="font-semibold">"You can only absorb 30g at a time"</span> — Your body continues to digest and utilize larger amounts, just more slowly.</li>
              <li><span className="font-semibold">"Protein is only for bodybuilders"</span> — Everyone needs adequate protein, regardless of physique goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Your protein needs depend on your goals, weight, activity level, and diet. Use the guidelines above as a flexible framework, and adjust based on your results and how you feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stay consistent, aim for quality sources, and don't stress perfection — progress is what counts. Over time, a well-balanced diet with adequate protein can improve strength, recovery, and body composition.
