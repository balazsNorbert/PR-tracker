            Why Warm Up Matters
          </h2>
          <p>
            Warm up before your workout prepares your muscles and joints. It increases blood flow, raises your body temperature, and improves flexibility, helping you perform better and reduce injury risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Skipping your warm-up can lead to stiffness, slower reaction times, and even injuries like strains or sprains. Warming up is especially important if you're training with heavy weights or doing high-intensity cardio.
          </p>

            What Happens in Your Body During a Warm-Up?
          </h2>
          <p>
            When you warm up, your heart rate gradually increases, blood vessels expand, and more oxygen reaches your muscles. This primes your body for exertion and boosts your nervous system, helping with coordination and reaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mentally, a warm-up helps you shift focus into workout mode. It's a great time to review your plan for the day and set your intent — whether it's hitting a new PR or simply staying consistent.

            Components of a Good Warm-Up
          </h2>
          <p>Effective warm-ups typically include these elements:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Light aerobic exercise (e.g., jogging, cycling)</li>
            <li>Dynamic stretches that mimic your workout movements</li>
            <li>Activation exercises to engage key muscle groups</li>
            <li>Mental preparation and breathing focus</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
            Sample Warm-Up Routine
          </h2>
          <p>Try this simple routine before your workout:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside">
            <li>5 minutes of light cardio like jogging or jump rope</li>
            <li>Dynamic leg swings, arm circles, and hip rotations</li>
            <li>10-15 bodyweight squats and lunges to activate legs</li>
            <li>Push-ups or band pull-aparts for upper body engagement</li>
            <li>Short movement-specific drills (e.g., light deadlifts or air squats)</li>
          </ol>
          <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
            Tailor Your Warm-Up to Your Workout
          </h2>
          <p>
            Your warm-up should reflect the type of training you're doing. If you're lifting heavy, prioritize joint mobility and activation. If you're doing cardio, a longer aerobic ramp-up may help.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, before leg day, include glute bridges or resistance band work. On upper body days, focus more on shoulder mobility and light pressing movements.
          </p>

            Common Warm-Up Mistakes to Avoid
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Skipping it altogether or rushing through it</li>
            <li>Static stretching (which can reduce power output) before intense activity</li>
            <li>Not warming up the muscles you'll actually use</li>
            <li>Doing too much and fatiguing yourself before the workout starts</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
            Final Thoughts
          </h2>
          <p>
            Don't skip your warm-up! A good warm-up primes your body for peak performance and keeps you injury-free. Make it part of your routine for safer and more effective workouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just 5-10 minutes of smart movement can make the difference between an average workout and one that pushes you forward.
