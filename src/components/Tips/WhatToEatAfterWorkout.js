              Why Knowing What to Eat After a Workout Matters
            </h2>
            <p>
              When you finish a workout, your muscles are in a state of breakdown. This is exactly when your body needs the right nutrients to repair tissue, grow stronger, and come back even better. Knowing what to eat after a workout can significantly improve your recovery, reduce soreness, and help you reach your fitness goals faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              Skipping post-workout nutrition may slow down recovery and limit your progress over time. This is especially true if you're training frequently or with high intensity.
            </p>

              Key Nutrients to Focus On
            </h2>
            <p>
              Your post-workout meal should center around two primary macronutrients:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                <strong>Protein</strong> - Essential for muscle repair and rebuilding. Aim for at least 20-30g of high-quality protein.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Carbohydrates</strong> - Help restore glycogen, your body's main fuel source. Combine fast-digesting carbs with protein for best results.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Including a small amount of healthy fats (like avocado or olive oil) is okay, but don't overdo it — fat slows digestion and could delay nutrient absorption.
            </p>

              Best Foods to Eat After Your Workout
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Grilled chicken with brown rice and steamed vegetables</li>
              <li>Protein shake with banana and oats</li>
              <li>Greek yogurt with berries and honey</li>
              <li>Eggs on whole-grain toast with spinach</li>
              <li>Salmon with sweet potato and asparagus</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              When to Eat After Your Workout
            </h2>
            <p>
              The best time to eat after a workout is within 30 to 60 minutes. This is often referred to as the “anabolic window” — the ideal timeframe for maximizing muscle repair and glycogen replenishment. If you wait too long, recovery may be less efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you can't eat a full meal right away, have a quick snack like a protein shake or a banana with peanut butter, and follow up with a meal within 2 hours.
            </p>

              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              What you eat after your workout is just as important as the training itself. By fueling your body properly with high-quality protein, complex carbs, and hydration, you'll feel better, perform better, and recover faster. Plan your post-workout meals just like you plan your workouts — your progress depends on it.
