            <p>
              Have you been training consistently but suddenly feel like you're not making any progress? You might be facing a workout plateau, a common part of the fitness journey where results seem to stall. The good news? It's completely normal, and there are ways to move past it.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">What Is a Workout Plateau?</h2>
            <p>
              A workout plateau happens when your body adapts to your training routine. That means your muscles, strength, or endurance stop improving, even though you're still working out regularly. This is actually a sign that your body has adjusted and it's time to make changes to keep growing.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">Why Do Plateaus Happen?</h2>
            <p className="font-semibold">There are several common reasons why progress slows down:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Doing the same workout routines repeatedly</li>
              <li>Not increasing intensity (no progressive overload)</li>
              <li>Overtraining without enough rest</li>
              <li>Insufficient or unbalanced nutrition</li>
              <li>Lack of mental focus or motivation</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">How to Break Through a Plateau</h2>
            <p>Here are proven ways to get back on track:</p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">1. Switch Up Your Routine</h3>
            <p>
              Introduce new exercises, rep ranges, or equipment. For example, swap machines for free weights or try bodyweight variations. Keeping your workouts fresh keeps your muscles guessing.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">2. Add Progressive Overload</h3>
            <p>
              Progress happens when you push your body. Gradually increase the weight, number of reps, or sets you do each week.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">3. Prioritize Recovery</h3>
            <p>
              Rest is just as important as training. Make sure you're getting enough sleep and taking at least one or two rest days per week.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">4. Improve Your Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
              Your body needs the right fuel to build muscle and recover. Focus on getting enough protein, and ensure you're eating enough calories to support your goals.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">5. Track Your Progress</h3>
            <p>
              Logging your workouts helps you notice when you're plateauing—and helps you spot patterns that work. Plus, it's motivating to see how far you've come.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Plateaus are not failures — they're signs that you've progressed and your body is ready for the next level. Stay consistent, make smart adjustments, and keep moving forward. You've got this!
