              How many exercises per muscle group should you do for the best results? Many lifters
              struggle to find the right balance between doing too little and overtraining. Choosing
              the right number of exercises helps you build muscle, <Link to="/tips/how-to-avoid-workout-plateaus" className="font-bold text-teal-800 hover:underline">avoid plateaus</Link>, injury, and keep making

              Why Exercise Selection Matters
            </h2>
            <p>
              Doing the right number of exercises per muscle group ensures you hit the muscle from
              different angles without wasting time or energy. More isn't always better — quality
              and good form are more important than endless sets.

              How Many Exercises Per Muscle Group?
            </h2>
            <p>
              A good rule of thumb is to perform 2 to 5 different exercises per muscle group in
              each workout. This allows enough variation to target the muscle effectively without
              unnecessary volume.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Large muscle groups (chest, back, legs): 3-5 exercises</li>
              <li>Smaller muscle groups (biceps, triceps, shoulders): 2-3 exercises</li>
              <li>Focus on compound lifts first, then add isolation work</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Volume and Intensity
            </h2>
            <p>
              Instead of doing too many exercises, focus on enough sets and reps with good form.
              Most lifters get great results with 3-4 sets per exercise and 8-12 reps per set,
              adjusting intensity based on goals.

              Should You Do the Same Exercises Every Workout?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Doing the same exercises every workout is fine for beginners who need to master good form.
              However, over time, adding some variety helps prevent plateaus and keeps training interesting.
              Focus on core compound lifts every week, but swap accessory exercises every few weeks to
              challenge your muscles in new ways.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Avoid Overtraining
            </h2>
            <p>
              More exercises can lead to overuse injuries and slow recovery. Listen to your body,
              track your progress, and remember that rest is when muscles actually grow.
            </p>

              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              So, how many exercises per muscle group should you do? Stick with 2-5 per muscle,
              focus on proper form, use progressive overload, and give your body time to recover.
              This simple approach will help you get stronger and build more muscle without wasting
              time in the gym.
