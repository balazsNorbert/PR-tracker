            Compound vs Isolation Exercises: What's the Difference?

            <p>
              Many lifters wonder whether they should focus more on compound or isolation exercises. Both
              have important roles in a balanced workout routine, but they work your body in different ways.
              Understanding the difference can help you build muscle and strength more effectively.

              What Are Compound Exercises?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Compound exercises involve multiple joints and muscle groups at once. Classic examples include
              squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and pull-ups. These movements help you lift heavier weights
              and engage several muscles together, making them great for building overall strength and
              efficiency.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              What Are Isolation Exercises?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Isolation exercises target a single muscle group and joint. Examples are bicep curls,
              tricep extensions, leg extensions, or lateral raises. These are useful for focusing on
              specific weak points or adding extra volume to a muscle that needs more work.

              Key Differences
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li><strong>Compound:</strong> Multi-joint, multiple muscles, heavier loads.</li>
              <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Single-joint, targets one muscle, lighter loads.</li>
              <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Compound builds strength and efficiency; isolation helps refine muscle shape and balance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Should You Use Both?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Absolutely. Most good programs combine both. Compound lifts should form the base of your
              routine, providing the biggest strength and growth stimulus. Isolation exercises are best
              used to address weak spots and add extra volume to smaller muscles.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Which Is Better?
            </h2>
            <p>
              It depends on your goals. If you're short on time or want the biggest results, focus on compound
              movements. But if you want balanced muscle development and a well-shaped physique, add isolation
              work too.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              So, compound vs isolation exercises — both have their place. Use compound lifts for your main
              strength and size gains, and isolation moves to refine and perfect your physique.
