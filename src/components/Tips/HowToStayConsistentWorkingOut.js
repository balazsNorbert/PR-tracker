              Why Consistency Matters More Than Perfection
            </h2>
            <p>
              Building a consistent workout routine is the key to long-term results. It's not about being perfect every day — it's about showing up regularly, even when it's hard. Staying consistent with working out helps you build habits that last, improve your fitness, and reach your goals faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              The truth is, even short workouts compound over time. A 20-minute session done consistently beats a 2-hour session you do once a month. Think long-term: consistency is your secret weapon.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Set Realistic and Specific Goals
            </h2>
            <p>
              Instead of vague goals like "get fit", aim for something specific and measurable — for example, "work out 3x per week", "complete 10 push-ups without stopping", or "run 5km without walking".
            </p>
            <p>
              Clear goals give you something to track and celebrate. Achieving even small goals builds confidence and fuels motivation to keep going.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">
              1. Schedule Your Workouts
            </h3>
            <p>
              Treat your workouts like appointments. Put them in your calendar, set reminders, and plan around them like you would any important commitment. Morning, lunch break, or evening — pick what works for your lifestyle.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">
              2. Start Small and Build Gradually
            </h3>
            <p>
              You don't need to work out 6 days a week to be consistent. Starting with just 2 or 3 short sessions is enough. Focus on building the habit first, then increase volume or intensity as you go.
            </p>
            <p>
              Progression happens when you're consistent, not when you push too hard too early and burn out.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">
              3. Track Your Workouts
            </h3>
            <p>
              Tracking helps you stay accountable and shows your progress. Whether it's with a fitness app, a journal, or a spreadsheet, logging your workouts gives you visual proof of your effort and growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              On days when motivation is low, reviewing past successes can remind you how far you've come.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">
              4. Find What You Enjoy
            </h3>
            <p>
              You're more likely to stick with workouts you look forward to. If lifting weights isn't fun for you, try cycling, swimming, martial arts, or hiking. Fitness doesn't have to be a chore.
            </p>
            <p>
              Try a variety of activities until something clicks — fun leads to frequency, and frequency builds consistency.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">
              5. Build a Support System
            </h3>
            <p>
              Support makes everything easier. Surround yourself with people who encourage your goals — whether it's a gym partner, online community, or personal trainer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even sharing your goals with a friend can increase your accountability and keep you going when motivation dips.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl text-teal-600">
              6. Make It Part of Your Identity
            </h3>
            <p>
              Don't just say "I'm trying to work out." Say "I'm the kind of person who works out." When you shift your identity, showing up becomes easier — it's just who you are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consistency is less about motivation and more about mindset. Your habits follow your identity.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              Consistency doesn't mean perfection, it means commitment. Focus on what you can do, not what you can't. Be flexible, forgive missed days, and get back to it. That's what builds results that last.
            </p>
            <p>
              Show up, do your best for the day, and keep moving forward. Over time, those small actions compound into big change.
