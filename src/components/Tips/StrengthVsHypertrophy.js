              What is the difference between strength and hypertrophy training? Many lifters wonder
              whether they should focus on building raw strength or maximizing muscle size. Both
              training styles are effective, but they use different rep ranges, loads, and goals.

              What Is Strength Training?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Strength training focuses on lifting heavier weights to increase maximum force
              output. It typically uses lower rep ranges (1-5 reps), higher weight, and longer rest
              periods to help your nervous system and muscles adapt to lifting heavy loads.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              What Is Hypertrophy Training?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Hypertrophy training is all about building bigger muscles. It uses moderate weights
              with moderate to high reps (6-15 reps) and shorter rest periods to maximize muscle
              fiber fatigue and stimulate growth. The focus is on muscle tension and volume.

              Key Differences
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Heavier weights, lower reps, longer rest.</li>
              <li><strong>Hypertrophy:</strong> Moderate weights, higher reps, shorter rest.</li>
              <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Strength aims for power and performance; hypertrophy aims for muscle size.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Can You Combine Strength and Hypertrophy?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Absolutely! Many successful training programs mix both styles. For example, you might
              lift heavy for your main compound exercises to build strength, then add accessory work
              with moderate reps for muscle size. This approach gives you the best of both worlds.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Which Should You Choose?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The best training style depends on your goals. If you want to lift heavier weights or
              compete in powerlifting, focus on strength training. If your main goal is to build
              muscle size and look more muscular, hypertrophy training is your best bet.
            </p>

              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              So, what's the difference between strength and hypertrophy training? Strength training
              helps you lift heavier, while hypertrophy training builds bigger muscles. Combining
              both can keep your workouts effective and balanced for long-term progress.
