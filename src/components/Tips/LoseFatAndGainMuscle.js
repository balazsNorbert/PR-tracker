              The Truth About Body Recomposition
            </h2>
            <p>
              One of the most common fitness questions is whether you can lose fat while gaining muscle at the same time—a process known as body recomposition. The good news is, yes, it's possible, but it requires a smart approach to nutrition, training, and recovery.

              How Body Recomposition Works
            </h2>
            <p>
              Losing fat requires a calorie deficit—burning more calories than you consume. Building muscle generally requires a calorie surplus and strength training. The key to body recomposition is finding the balance where you eat slightly below maintenance calories but train in a way that signals your body to preserve and grow muscle.

              Who Can Benefit Most?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Beginners, people returning from a training break, or those with higher body fat percentages are most likely to see great results from recomposition. Their bodies respond quickly to strength training while still having enough energy reserves to build new muscle.

              Nutrition Tips for Losing Fat and Gaining Muscle
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Eat a High-Protein Diet:</strong> Protein helps preserve muscle while losing fat. Aim for at least 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Maintain a Moderate Calorie Deficit:</strong> Don't crash diet. A small deficit (10-20% below maintenance) is enough to lose fat without sacrificing muscle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Time Your Nutrients:</strong> Eating protein-rich meals before and after workouts can support muscle repair and growth.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Training for Maximum Results
            </h2>
            <p>
              Focus on strength training with progressive overload. Lifting heavy and gradually increasing weights signals your body to build muscle. Include compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, and presses. Cardio can help burn extra calories but should not replace strength work.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Recovery and Sleep Matter Too
            </h2>
            <p>
              Building muscle while losing fat is demanding. Your body needs rest to repair muscle fibers and recover. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep nightly and avoid overtraining by scheduling rest days.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Realistic Expectations
            </h2>
            <p>
              Body recomposition takes time and consistency. You may not see the scale move much because you're trading fat for muscle, but your body will look leaner and stronger. Measure progress through photos, strength gains, and how your clothes fit.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              Losing fat and gaining muscle at the same time is achievable with the right plan. Focus on strength training, eat enough protein, recover well, and stay patient. Your hard work will pay off with a stronger, leaner physique.
