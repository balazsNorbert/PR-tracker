              Why Workout Frequency Matters
            </h2>
            <p>
              How many days a week you work out can significantly impact your results. Your body needs the right balance of training and recovery to progress. Whether your goal is building strength, burning fat, or staying fit, your weekly workout schedule should be aligned with your goals and your lifestyle.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Recommended Training Frequency by Goal
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li><strong>Beginners:</strong> 2-3 days per week focusing on full-body workouts</li>
              <li><strong>Muscle Gain:</strong> 4-6 days per week using split routines like push/pull/legs</li>
              <li><strong>Fat Loss:</strong> 3-5 days per week with a mix of strength training and cardio</li>
              <li><strong>General Health:</strong> At least 3 days per week of moderate-intensity activity</li>
              <li><strong>Athletes:</strong> 5-6 days per week with tailored programming and recovery</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Don't Forget Recovery Days
            </h2>
            <p>
              Recovery is when your muscles rebuild and get stronger. Overtraining without rest can lead to burnout, fatigue, or even injury. Make sure to include 1-2 rest days per week, and listen to your body if you feel unusually sore, tired, or unmotivated.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Finding the Right Balance
            </h2>
            <p>
              The ideal number of workout days will depend on your time availability, fitness level, recovery rate, and personal preference. Quality beats quantity. It's better to train consistently 3 times a week with intensity and focus than half-heartedly every day.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              Working out the right number of days per week helps you stay motivated, avoid burnout, and see long-term results. Start with what feels sustainable, then build from there. The key is consistency—results come from showing up regularly, not from perfection.
