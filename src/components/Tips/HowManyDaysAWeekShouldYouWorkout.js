              Why Workout Frequency Matters
            </h2>
            <p>
              Wondering how often should you work out to reach your goals faster? Your workout frequency is one of the key factors that decide whether you build muscle, burn fat, or just spin your wheels.
              Training too little can slow progress, but training too much without rest can lead to <Link to="/tips/how-to-avoid-workout-plateaus" className="font-bold text-teal-800 hover:underline">plateaus</Link>.

            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Recommended Training Frequency by Goal
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li><strong>Beginners:</strong> 2-3 days per week with full-body workouts to learn the basics.</li>
              <li><strong>Muscle Gain:</strong> 4-6 days per week using split routines like push/pull/legs or upper/lower splits.</li>
              <li><strong>Fat Loss:</strong> 3-5 days per week mixing resistance training with cardio or HIIT.</li>
              <li><strong>General Health:</strong> At least 3 days per week of moderate-intensity training for heart health and mobility.</li>
              <li><strong>Athletes:</strong> 5-6 days per week with planned deloads and recovery sessions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-base md:text-lg xl:text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600">
              Don't Forget Recovery Days
            </h2>
            <p>
              Your body gets stronger while you rest — not while you train. Include 1-2 rest days or active recovery days per week to avoid fatigue, <Link to="/tips/muscle-soreness-and-growth" className="font-bold text-teal-800 hover:underline">soreness</Link>, and injuries. If you ever feel rundown or unmotivated, that's a sign to check your workout frequency and make sure you're not overdoing it.

              Finding the Right Balance
            </h2>
            <p>
              The best answer to how often should you work out depends on your experience, schedule, recovery ability, and what you actually enjoy doing. More isn't always better — better is better. Focus on consistency and quality instead of chasing daily sessions you can't stick to long-term.
