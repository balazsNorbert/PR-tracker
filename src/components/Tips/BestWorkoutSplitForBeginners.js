              Why the Right Workout Split Matters
            </h2>
            <p>
              Many new lifters jump into random workouts without a clear plan. A smart workout split organizes your training week so you target each muscle group enough times, balance recovery, and keep progressing. For beginners, simple splits are usually more effective than complicated routines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Picking the right split also helps you avoid common mistakes like overtraining or neglecting certain muscle groups. A balanced plan ensures that you train your entire body evenly, which builds a solid foundation and reduces the risk of muscle imbalances or injuries later on.

              Best Workout Splits for Beginners
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                <strong>Full-Body Split:</strong> Train your whole body in each session. Great for 2-3 gym days per week. Ideal for learning exercises, practicing form, and building a solid base.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Upper/Lower Split:</strong> Divide your week into upper body days and lower body days. Perfect for 3-4 days per week. Lets you train each muscle group twice weekly for better growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Push/Pull/Legs Split:</strong> More advanced but still beginner-friendly if you can train 4-5 days weekly. Splits your training by movement patterns: push (chest, shoulders, triceps), pull (back, biceps), and legs.
              </li>
            </ul>

              How to Choose the Best Workout Split for You
            </h2>
            <p>
              The best workout split for beginners is the one you can stick to long-term. Consider your weekly schedule, recovery needs, and experience level. If you're busy, a 3-day full-body split is often perfect. If you enjoy training more often, an upper/lower or push/pull/legs split might keep you engaged.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, think about your recovery. If your sleep, nutrition, or stress levels aren't ideal yet, stick with fewer training days to ensure your body has enough time to rebuild and grow stronger. More is not always better — consistency is what really makes the difference.

              Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid
            </h2>
            <p>
              Many beginners switch programs too often or chase advanced splits too soon. Stick with your chosen plan for at least 8-12 weeks before making major changes. This gives your body enough time to adapt and show real results. Avoid ego lifting — focus on form first, weight second.
